PolyShark already fits the ERC-7715 story well (automated agent, bounded USDC spend on Polymarket), but there are several gaps relative to what MetaMask is explicitly rewarding in this hackathon.[1][2]

## 1. ERC-7715 Usage Depth

**What you have (strengths)**  
- Clear “10 USDC/day for 30 days” style permission aligned with canonical examples.[1]
- Agent actually uses the allowance to execute trades autonomously, not just one-shot calls.  
- Wallet layer is permission-aware: checks remaining allowance before trading.

**Gaps**  
- No visible use of the *richer* permission surface from the spec (e.g., adjustable parameters, multiple permission types, time windows, revocation UX).[3][4]
- No explicit lifecycle narrative: “set up session account → request → redeem → monitor → revoke,” which MetaMask docs call out as the core pattern.[5][1]

**Impact**  
Judges may see it as “good example of a single ERC-20 periodic spend permission,” but not as a **deep exploration** of Advanced Permissions.

**Closing the gap (concrete)**  
- Add at least one more permission type, e.g.  
  - Native token gas stipend or a separate small ETH stream to pay Polymarket gas.[4]
- Surface a small **Permission Center** in the dashboard:  
  - Show current permission config (token, amount/day, expiry).  
  - Button to “Request more,” “Tighten limit,” or “Revoke permission.”  
- Document the full lifecycle in `metamask/v1.md` using MetaMask’s own language and diagrams.[5][1]

## 2. Alignment with “Best On-Chain Automation” Track

**What you have (strengths)**  
- Always-on arbitrage agent that executes without further popups once permission is granted, which the prize track explicitly encourages.[6][2]
- Strong correctness story: off-chain constraint engine, hostile execution simulator, statistical validation.

**Gaps**  
- Automation is **single-protocol and single-task** (Polymarket logical arb). Many winners in similar tracks show at least:  
  - Multi-protocol routing or cross-market logic, or  
  - Adaptive policies (e.g., change behavior as market regime or permissions change).[2]
- No explicit “automation policy” tied to permissions (e.g., different strategies for low vs high allowance, or time-based behavior).

**Impact**  
Technically solid, but might look like a specialized bot rather than a **generalizable automation pattern**.

**Closing the gap**  
- Expose strategy “modes” controlled by the same ERC-7715 permission:  
  - Conservative mode when remaining allowance < X% (only highest edge trades).  
  - Aggressive mode when allowance is mostly unused (more frequent, smaller trades).  
- Add a small cross-market dimension: even just 2–3 Polymarket categories (e.g., politics, sports, crypto) with different risk caps to show policy variety.  
- In README, explicitly pitch PolyShark as a **template for any agentic trader** that consumes permissions and market data, not just for Polymarket.

## 3. UX and Human‑Readable Permission Experience

**What you have (strengths)**  
- Good copy for the core permission: “PolyShark may automatically trade up to 10 USDC per day on your behalf…”.  
- Dashboard shows allowance consumption and PnL.

**Gaps**  
- MetaMask stresses **human-readable configuration** and giving users knobs for amount/period.[7][1]
- Judges expect to *see* the permission UI and how your app prepares the config object (titles, descriptions, constraints).

**Impact**  
UX story may feel under-leveraged, even though your backend is strong.

**Closing the gap**  
- Show the **exact JSON permission configuration** in docs plus a screenshot/GIF of the MetaMask confirmation dialog.[1]
- Allow the user to:  
  - Choose token (USDC vs another ERC-20 on the same network if available).  
  - Adjust daily limit (slider or presets: 5 / 10 / 20 USDC).  
  - Adjust duration (7 / 30 / 90 days).  
- Add a “dry-run mode” toggle in UI: same automation, but stops before actual execution if permission not granted (good for judges to play without real txs).

***

## 4. Envio + MetaMask Story (Hackathon Co‑Sponsor Angle)

**What you have (strengths)**  
- Envio HyperIndex in the architecture as the market-state source.  
- Clean separation: Envio for data, MetaMask for execution permissions.

**Gaps**  
- Hackathon is **MetaMask x Envio**; they will likely reward projects that showcase both partners **together** in a compelling way.[8][9]
- Your docs mention Envio, but you could make the synergy more explicit:  
  - Indexer isn’t just a data source, it’s what *enables safe automation* (low-latency, reliable).

**Impact**  
You risk judges seeing it as “MetaMask agent that happens to use Envio,” instead of “Envio-powered agent that unlocks safe MetaMask automation.”

**Closing the gap**  
- In README and context: add an explicit section “Why Envio matters for safe automation” (latency, reliability, replay capability).[10][11]
- Show an example Envio GraphQL query (or HyperSync snippet) that directly feeds your arbitrage detector.  
- Bonus: surface **Envio health / data-lag metrics** in dashboard (e.g., “Index delay: 250 ms”), reinforcing that you’re thinking about reliability in automation.

***

## 5. Reference Implementation vs. Official Toolkit Ecosystem

**What you have (strengths)**  
- Custom Rust stack, which is technically impressive and unusual.  
- Clear architectural separation that maps well to the Smart Accounts Kit concepts.

**Gaps**  
- MetaMask pushes **Delegation Toolkit / Smart Accounts Kit / create-gator-app** as preferred developer pathways.[12][13][2]
- PolyShark doesn’t obviously tie back to these templates or tooling, so judges might see less “ecosystem impact.”

**Impact**  
You’re very strong on “technical difficulty,” weaker on “ecosystem impact / reusability.”[2]

**Closing the gap**  
- Add a small **JS/TS bridge** using the official Smart Accounts Kit to:  
  - Request permissions in a small front-end, then pass session info into the Rust agent.  
- Provide a “PolyShark as a template” section:  
  - How someone using `create-gator-app` could adapt *your* execution/constraint model for another domain (e.g., DEX trading).  
- Explicitly reference and link to the Delegation Toolkit / Smart Accounts Kit docs in `metamask/v1.md` and README.[13][12][1]

***

## 6. Storytelling and Demo Expectations

**What you have (strengths)**  
- Excellent internal docs: `context.md`, `spec.md`, `math.md`, `implementation.md`, `metamask/v1.md`.  
- A coherent philosophy: “If markets contradict themselves, eat the contradiction.”

**Gaps**  
- Hackathon requires **a video demo + hosted demo** (or at least emphasizes this heavily), plus a very crisp narrative about the ERC-7715 win.[14][2]
- Judges may not have time to read your whole doc stack; they need a 3–5 minute path from **problem → ERC-7715 solution → Envio data → live UX**.

**Impact**  
Risk is under-communication: you’ve done more work than they might realize.

**Closing the gap**  
- Script a 3–4 minute demo:  
  1. Connect MetaMask, request permission (show UI).  
  2. Show Envio data feed updating.  
  3. Show PolyShark taking trades autonomously, consuming allowance.  
  4. Show revocation and how agent immediately respects it.  
- In README top section, add a **TL;DR for judges** with:  
  - 1–2 bullets on what’s special about your ERC-7715 usage.  
  - Link to demo video and live dashboard.

## 7. Safety, Guardrails, and Failure Modes

**What you have (strengths)**  
- Strong internal guardrails: skip trades when expected profit ≤ 0, realistic cost modelling, dynamic sizing.  
- ERC-7715 limit ensures **hard cap** on losses.

**Gaps**  
- MetaMask docs and hackathon materials emphasize **security and user safety** as a key motivation.[7][1]
- You don’t yet fully narrate what happens when:  
  - Envio data is stale or fails.  
  - Polymarket API changes or rate-limits.  
  - MetaMask / session account errors during redemption.

**Impact**  
Judges might not see how safe the system is in pathological cases.

**Closing the gap**  
- Add explicit failure-handling paths in docs and code comments:  
  - If data delay > X ms, suspend trading.  
  - If N consecutive API failures, go into safe mode.  
  - If permission query fails, assume 0 allowance.  
- Expose a visible **“Agent status”** in the dashboard: RUNNING / SAFE MODE / PERMISSION EXPIRED.

### Summary of Priority Fixes Before Submission

If time is limited, focus on:

1. **UX & Permissions Depth**  
   - Make limits adjustable and human-readable; show the MetaMask UI and config object clearly.[3][1]

2. **Envio x MetaMask Narrative**  
   - Emphasize how low-latency Envio data plus ERC-7715 makes safe, always-on agents possible.[8][10]

3. **Demo Storyline**  
   - Polished video + README TL;DR highlighting:  
     - “Agentic Polymarket arb with cryptographically enforced daily USDC limit.”
